GitHub for Jive - Developer Notes
=================================

This service is for anything that is coming from Github or anything coming from the
browser that will go to or query Github via a proxied api call. If something on the 
browser side needs to access both in a proxied query then put it in this service.

Look at the current routes to get a sense of the kinds of endpoints to add to this service.
