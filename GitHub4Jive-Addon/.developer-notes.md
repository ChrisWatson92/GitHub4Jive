GitHub for Jive - Developer Notes
=================================

## Prerequisites

Before running these instructions:

1. You need to be able to install add-ons on the Jive server being used for this tutorial. Registered developers can use the [Jive Developer Sandbox](https://sandbox.jiveon.com/), which has the sandbox property turned on.
2. Your development system must be accessible to the Jive server and must have the Jive Node SDK installed on it. Consider using a cloud-based IDE for this tutorial. You can follow the first three steps in [Using Nitrous.IO with the Jive Node SDK](https://community.jivesoftware.com/docs/DOC-123753) to get up and running with Nitrous.IO.


## Instructions

The following instructions should help you get the GitHub4Jive project onto the [developer sandbox](https://sandbox.jiveon.com) for testing.

1.  Determine the hostname for your service. All subsequent references to `SERVICE_HOSTNAME` should be replaced with this hostname. If using [Nitrous.IO](https://www.nitrous.io/), you can determine the hostname by selecting any **Port** submenu item from the **Preview** menu. When recording the hostname, be sure to omit the port number and do not include a terminating backslash (/).<br />
    For example: `https://blazing-example-38-138798.usw1-2.nitrousbox.com`
1.  Clone the [GitHub4Jive](https://github.com/jivesoftware/GitHub4Jive) repository.<br/>
    `git clone https://github.com/jivesoftware/GitHub4Jive.git`
1.  Change to the add-on subdirectory.<br/>
    `cd GitHub4Jive/GitHub4Jive-Addon`
1.  Update your Node.js dependencies.<br/>
    `npm update`
1.  Update the `clientUrl` property in the `jiveclientconfiguration.json` file, which can be found in the `GitHub4Jive-Addon` subdirectory. If you are using Nitrous.IO, refresh the file browser panel before browsing for this file.<br/>
    `"clientUrl": "http://SERVICE_HOSTNAME",`<br/>
    Remember to replace the `SERVICE_HOSTNAME` value with whatever you got from the first step.
1.  (Optional) Change the `name` property value in the same file to something personalized.<br/>
    `"name" : "GitHub4Jive", -> "name": "My GitHub4Jive Project Name",`
1.  Authorize your service's use of the GitHub API using your GitHub account.
    1.  Log into [GitHub](https://github.com).
    2.  From the GitHub settings, register a [new developer application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).
    3.  Choose a recognizable `Application name`.
    4.  Set the home page URL to any URL. This URL will be accessible from within the Jive place you will create.
    5.  Set the `Authorization call URL` to the following URL:<br/>
        `http://SERVICE_HOSTNAME:8090/github/oauth/callback`<br/>
        Remember to replace the `SERVICE_HOSTNAME` value with whatever you got from the first step.
    6.  Click **Register application**.
1.  Grab the Client ID and the Client Secret specified in the GitHub application page and fill in the OAuth key and secret within the `jiveclientconfiguration.json` file.<br/>
        `"oauth2ConsumerKey": "GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID",`<br/>
        `"oauth2ConsumerSecret": "GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET",`<br/>
    Replace the `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID` with the GitHub Client ID and `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` with the GitHub Client Secret.
1.  Start your GitHub4Jive service.<br />
    `node app.js`
1.  Download the `extension.zip` file produced from starting your service. (If you are using Nitrous.IO, refresh the file browser panel before browsing for this file. Right click on the file to download it.)
1.  Navigate to [https://sandbox.jiveon.com/addon-services!input.jspa](https://sandbox.jiveon.com/addon-services!input.jspa) in the Jive Sandbox to install your newly created add-on.
1.  Upload `extension.zip`.

You can now create a group or project within the Jive Sandbox and select the GitHub4Jive place template (found from the *Other* category) to get started.
