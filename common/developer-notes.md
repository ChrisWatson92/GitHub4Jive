GitHub for Jive - Developer Notes
=================================

Please use this directory to house code that can be used between integration pieces.
Ex: GitHubFacade provides a nice abstraction on the GitHubApi and produces a consistent
API for tiles, apps, services, etc to access uniformly.

Please use <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q">Q.js promises</a> to manage asynchronous operations.
