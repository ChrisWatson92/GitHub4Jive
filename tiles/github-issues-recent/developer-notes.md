GitHub for Jive - Developer Notes
=================================

As a any Jive User with access to the place linked to a GitHub repository:
I should be able to see the most recent issues for the linked repository.
        <ul>
            <li>Each issue should be Linked to GitHub.</li>
            <li>Each issue should be linked to its Jive Discussion if it exists.</li>
        </ul>

As a GitHub Contributor:
I should be able to see Issues that I have commented on. Above others, unless it has been closed or otherwise inactive. 
    In other words, it should not hide new issues by showing old Issues that I don't need to see anymore.
