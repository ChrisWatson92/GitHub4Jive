GitHub for Jive - Developer Notes
=================================

As a any Jive User with access to the place linked to a GitHub repository:
I should be able to see the most recent commits that have occurred on the linked repository.
        <ul>
            <li>Each commit should be able to take me back to its GitHub page.</li>
            <li>Each commit should show me the changes that occurred in that commit.</li>
            <li>I should be able to see the diff of the files, either one by one or all at once. It would be nice to see it in Jive.</li>
        </ul>
