GitHub4Jive
===========

This project is to demonstrate the power of integration with Jive. By combining all 
of the major collaborative elements in GitHub in one addon Jive can drive innovation
with rich discussions and quick access to GitHub resources within Jive. Tiles, apps,
services, webhooks, and cartridges will be used to make this experience as natural and
powerful as possible.

If you would like to contribute please read the developer notes to see user stories and
