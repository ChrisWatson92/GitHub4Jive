# GitHub4Jive

This project demonstrates the power of integrating with the Jive Platform. By combining all
of the major collaborative elements of GitHub into one add-on, Jive can drive innovation
with rich discussions and quick access to GitHub resources, all from within Jive. Tiles, apps,
services, web hooks, and cartridges are used to make this experience both natural and
powerful.
