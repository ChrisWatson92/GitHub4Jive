# GitHub4Jive #
This project is to demonstrate the power of integration with Jive. By combining all
of the major collaborative elements in GitHub in one add-on Jive can drive innovation
with rich discussions and quick access to GitHub resources within Jive. Tiles, apps,
services, web hooks, and cartridges will be used to make this experience as natural and
powerful as possible.

Together, let's brew up something awesome!
